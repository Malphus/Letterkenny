        <p>Letterkenny is a Canadian comedy written by Jared Keeso and Jacob Tierney.  It follows
        the stories of the Hicks, the Skids and the Hockey Players.  They also have The Letterkenny
        Live comedy tour as well.  Season 1 follows Wayne as he retakes his title of the toughest 
        guy in Letterkenny while working his produce stand, choring, and hanging out with his 
        buds Daryl, Squirrely Dan and his sister Katy.  There is a lot of... colorful language, so 
        keep that in mind if you decide to watch it.
